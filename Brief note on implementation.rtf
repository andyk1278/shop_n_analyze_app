\f0\fs24 \cf0 	For our materialized views we chose to create a Product_Sum and Customer_Sum table. The Product_Sum table has columns (product_id, quarter, order_count, total_cost) where order_count is the total amount of the product sold within each quarter and the total_cost is the amount in $ within each quarter. The Customer_Sum table has columns (customer_id, quarter, order_count, total_cost) where order_count and total_cost are the summed values for each customer during each quarter.\
	The DataGenerator.java file has been edited to incrementally auto-update our precomputed tables through the use of triggers on inserts to the Sales, Customers, and Products tables.}
